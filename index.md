I am a game art major at CSUF, minoring in computer science. I plan to graduate in 2026

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs
*Lab 2
  While very simple, lab 2 is listed on my list of favorites because I started to learn how to code with python. My first ever project I did in python when this boy from highschool was teaching me was a madlib. So this lab was very familiar to me and I know that python and C++ are different languages. It was a nice introduction to strings, and learning the difference between std::cout and std::cin are. Along with their respective arrow symbols. Though it did make me have to look up what the types of nouns and verbs are, this lab also showed me some of the rules of formatting the code to Google format standards. Like the line wrapping we had to do! I really like this lab for how simple it was and how, if I remember correctly, I did this lab completely on my own even with the debugging.

*Lab 3 part 1
  This project is one of my favorites because it was another lab about the fundamentals but I chose part 3 specifically because it was about learning ‘double,’ functions, replace return statements, and start to learn how to use the make tool. This lab was a bit of a learning curve for me because I was starting to learn how to read the error messages. I kept getting the undefined identifier error message and such. 

*Lab 4 part 2
  This lab was getting me excited because I’m a game art major and I can finally do something that is related to games. While in a later lab it's more complex with a file hiding the secret number, this game involves two players within the same terminal.  This project was all about if statements and else statements, a struggle at first with the ‘else’ portion because I was confusing it with “else if”. My partner didnt really help me much at all so this was another project that I practically worked on all by myself, it was really good practice. 

*Lab 7
  The parking rules project! This project was about understanding constraints and coding the program to check what is in the command line. I’m proud of this one because i was able to finish the lab almost the day that we got it assigned. I also really liked how you have to make sure you track the relationships between the days and streets.  The only fix I had to do outside of lab day was changing a spelling error my partner and I made in parking.cc. Once fixed, it was easy peasy for it to pass the test. 

*Lab 11 part 2
  Another game! It's nearly the same game from lab 4 but instead of gaving two players, it's a one player game with the secret number being chosen by the programs ‘randomly’ and the player has to guess it. The program will again tell it if it's geting closer and they only have a few chances. Though it felt much harder this time around since I had to work with hilo_functions.cc this time. I just learned about secret_(secret) from the previous part of the lab and I did receive guidance for this. I was stuck on the part of counting how many guesses were left. I completely forgot that I could just write it as --guesses_left_ otherwise I was happy to work on another game project.
